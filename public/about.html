<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I’m Subiksha Selvarajah, a passionate and self-driven web developer currently pursuing
a degree in Software Engineering. With a strong foundation in programming and a creative mindset,
I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
and Node.js. My interest in web development began with a curiosity about how websites work and
grew into a deep desire to create digital experiences that are both visually appealing and 
highly functional.</p>

<p>Throughout my academic journey and personal projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience in front-end
and back-end development, consistently learning new technologies and frameworks. Whether it’s 
developing full-stack applications, solving real-world problems, or collaborating on team-based 
projects, I take pride in writing clean code and delivering efficient solutions. I'm particularly
passionate about creating platforms that improve accessibility, user experience, and performance on 
all devices.</p>

<p>As I continue to grow in this field, my goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer 
and eventually transition into cloud-based web development. I’m always excited to explore new tools,
contribute to impactful projects, and take on freelancing opportunities that challenge me. For me,
web development is not just a career path but a way to bring ideas to life through technology and
creativity.</p>
